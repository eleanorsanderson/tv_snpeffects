This repository contains two main files. 

1. 'Effects at time points 15 and 50.pdf' is a short document that calculates the effect of the exposure in Simulation 1 in Tian and Burgess 2023 when time points 15 and 50 are included in the estimation.
2. 'code to estimate snp effects over time.R' is an R script to generate the effects of the genetic variants over time for file 1 based on the function and parameters given in Tian and Burgess 2023.
